## Our Mission

### Cryptography Recommendations are Hard

There have been many attempts by cryptography and security experts to
create a definitive set of "right answers".

In addition to standardization efforts (e.g. FIPS 140-2 and NIST's algorithm
recommendations), several individuals and companies have attempted to codify
the best practices for state-of-the-art cryptography:

* [Percival, 2009](https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-11-cryptographic-right-answers.html)
* [Ptacek, 2015](https://gist.github.com/tqbf/be58d2d39690c3b366ad)
* [Toponce, 2016](https://gist.github.com/atoponce/07d8d4c833873be2f68c34f9afc5a78a)
* [Latacora, 2018](https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html)

However, these efforts are *ad hoc* and carry no freshness guarantees.
The authors believe the Internet is better served by a living document that
encapsulates the current state-of-the-art (with snapshots for point-in-time
verification, accountability, and transparency).
